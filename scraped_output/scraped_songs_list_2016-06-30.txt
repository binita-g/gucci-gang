verse 1 you shadow light did feel u another star fade away afraid aim sight wanna see u alight pre chorus 1 where where where was fantasy where were imaginary chorus where atlantis sea sea where another dream the monster running wild inside i faded i faded so lost i faded i faded so lost i faded verse 2 these shallow water never met i needed i letting go deeper dive eternal silence sea i breathing alive pre chorus 2 where where under bright faded light you set heart fire where where chorus where atlantis sea sea where another dream the monster running wild inside i faded i faded so lost i faded i faded so lost i faded
